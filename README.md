## Get started

```bash
pip install mcp-anything

# Generate an MCP server from any codebase
mcp-anything generate /path/to/your/app

# Or from a URL (OpenAPI, GraphQL, gRPC spec)
mcp-anything generate https://api.example.com/openapi.json

# Or directly from a local spec file
mcp-anything generate ./openapi.json
```

You get a complete, pip-installable MCP server in `./mcp-<name>-server/`. Add it to your agent in seconds:

**stdio (local, default):** add `mcp.json` to your Claude Code `.mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-app": { "command": "mcp-my-app", "args": [] }
  }
}
```

**HTTP (remote/shared, recommended):** start the server and point your agent at it:
```bash
mcp-anything generate /path/to/app --transport http
mcp-my-app  # server runs on http://localhost:8000/sse
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-app": { "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse" }
  }
}
```

## Targets

By default, mcp-anything generates a **Python / FastMCP** server. Use `--target=mcp-use` to generate a **TypeScript / mcp-use** server instead:

```bash
mcp-anything generate /path/to/app --target mcp-use
```

The TypeScript server uses the [mcp-use](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use) SDK and ships with a built-in inspector.

| | `--target fastmcp` (default) | `--target mcp-use` |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Python | TypeScript |
| SDK | FastMCP | mcp-use |
| Transport | stdio / HTTP | HTTP (port 3000) |
| Inspector | External | Built-in at /inspector |
| Install | `pip install -e .` | `npm install && npm run dev` |

## Scoping: control what gets exposed

Large codebases can have hundreds or thousands of endpoints. You don't want all of them as MCP tools. Three mechanisms let you control scope:

**Quick filter with `--include` / `--exclude`:**
```bash
# Only expose /api/v2 endpoints
mcp-anything generate ./my-app --include "/api/v2/*"

# Exclude internal and debug routes
mcp-anything generate ./my-app --exclude "/internal/*" --exclude "debug_*"
```

**Review mode — curate before generating:**
```bash
# Step 1: analyze and pause
mcp-anything generate ./my-app --review

# Step 2: edit the generated scope.yaml (enable/disable per capability)
vim mcp-my-app-server/scope.yaml

# Step 3: resume generation with your curated scope
mcp-anything generate ./my-app --resume
```

**Reusable scope file:**
```bash
# Use a pre-built scope file (check it into your repo)
mcp-anything generate ./my-app --scope-file ./mcp-scope.yaml
```

Patterns match against capability names, source file paths, and descriptions using glob syntax. In the scope file, you can also set `enabled: false` on individual capabilities for precise control.

## Description overrides: customize tool descriptions

Auto-generated descriptions come from source code (docstrings, OpenAPI summaries, route comments). They're usually good enough, but sometimes you want cleaner wording for your LLM agent.

After generation, a `descriptions.yaml` file is written to the output directory with every tool and parameter description. Edit it, then re-run with `--description` to apply your changes:

```bash
# 1. Generate as usual
mcp-anything generate ./my-app

# 2. Edit descriptions
vim mcp-my-app-server/descriptions.yaml
```

The file looks like this:

```yaml
# Edit tool descriptions below. Run `mcp-anything generate --description` to apply.
tools:
  list_users:
    description: "List all users with optional filtering"
    parameters:
      role:
        description: "Filter by user role"
      limit:
        description: "Max results to return"
  create_user:
    description: "Create a new user account"
    parameters:
      name:
        description: "Full name of the user"
```

```bash
# 3. Apply overrides — run from the generated server directory
cd mcp-my-app-server
mcp-anything generate --description

# Or from anywhere, pointing to the output directory
mcp-anything generate --description -o ./mcp-my-app-server
```

Only changed descriptions are applied. The pipeline detects edits and re-generates only the affected phases (implement, document, package), keeping everything else intact.

### Why we generate AGENTS.md

MCP solves tool *invocation* — an agent calls a tool and gets a result. It doesn't solve tool *discovery* at the project level.

When an agent like Claude Code opens your repo, it reads `AGENTS.md` before making any MCP calls. That file tells it what the server can do, which tools exist, and how to use them — without needing an active connection. As [this article](https://itnext.io/mcp-is-dead-long-live-mcp-a67bd74a6576) argues, the next generation of agent workflows depends on agents being able to reason about available capabilities *before* invoking them. `AGENTS.md` is that bridge: a human-readable, agent-indexed map of everything the generated server exposes.

### Why prefer HTTP transport

stdio MCP runs the server as a local subprocess — one process per agent session, tied to your machine. It works for personal use but doesn't scale.

HTTP transport (`--transport http`) lets you:
- Deploy once, connect from anywhere (CI, cloud agents, teammates)
- Share a single server instance across multiple agent sessions
- Run in Docker or any container platform

For anything beyond local prototyping, HTTP is the right default.

## Concrete example: GitHub MCP Server

The [official GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) is a hand-built Go project exposing ~80 curated tools (issues, PRs, repos, actions, security alerts, etc.). It took a team months to build and maintain.

What happens if you point mcp-anything at GitHub's public OpenAPI spec instead?

```bash
mcp-anything generate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/rest-api-description/main/descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.json --name github --no-llm
```

|  | Official (hand-built) | **mcp-anything (auto-generated)** |
|--|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Language** | Go | Python |
| **Build time** | Months | Seconds |
| **Tools** | ~80 (curated subset) | ~1,093 (every API operation) |
| **Backend** | Native Go SDK + GraphQL | `httpx` HTTP proxy from OpenAPI spec |
| **Auth** | PAT / OAuth | PAT via `GITHUB_API_KEY` env var |
| **Transport** | stdio, HTTP | stdio (default), HTTP (`--transport http`) |
| **Docs** | Hand-written README | Auto-generated AGENTS.md + MCP resources |

The generated server covers **every** GitHub REST API endpoint — repos, issues, PRs, actions, packages, security advisories, code search, gists, orgs, teams, notifications, and more. Each endpoint becomes an MCP tool with typed parameters extracted from the OpenAPI spec.

The official server is **curated**: 80 tools chosen for what LLMs actually need, with custom logic and GraphQL integration. The auto-generated server is **comprehensive**: 1,093 tools covering the entire API surface. It's the difference between a bespoke suit and an instant wardrobe — one fits perfectly, the other covers everything immediately.

See [`examples/github-server/`](examples/github-server/) for the full generated code.

### Scoping down to match the official server

But what if you only want the same ~80 tools the official server exposes? Use `--scope-file`:

```bash
mcp-anything generate \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/rest-api-description/main/descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.json \
  --name github-scoped --no-llm \
  --scope-file examples/github-server-scoped/scope.yaml \
  -o examples/github-server-scoped
```

|  | Official (hand-built) | Full auto-generated | **Scoped auto-generated** |
|--|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Tools** | ~80 (curated) | 1,093 (every endpoint) | **67 (matching official)** |
| **Build time** | Months | ~6 seconds | ~6 seconds |
| **Coverage** | Curated subset + GraphQL | Entire REST API | Same REST endpoints as official |
| **Scope control** | Hardcoded in Go | None needed | `scope.yaml` (69 lines) |

The scope file ([`examples/github-server-scoped/scope.yaml`](examples/github-server-scoped/scope.yaml)) uses `exclude_patterns: ["*"]` to exclude everything by default, then `enabled: true` on the 67 specific tools that map to official endpoints. 11 official tools use GraphQL or Copilot-specific APIs and have no REST equivalent — these are documented in the scope file.

**Reproduce it yourself:**

```bash
# 1. Generate the full server (1,093 tools)
mcp-anything generate \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/rest-api-description/main/descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.json \
  --name github --no-llm

# 2. Generate the scoped server (67 tools, matching official)
mcp-anything generate \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/rest-api-description/main/descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.json \
  --name github-scoped --no-llm \
  --scope-file examples/github-server-scoped/scope.yaml

# 3. Or use review mode to curate interactively
mcp-anything generate \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/rest-api-description/main/descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.json \
  --name github-custom --no-llm --review
# Edit mcp-github-custom-server/scope.yaml, then:
mcp-anything generate \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/rest-api-description/main/descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.json \
  --name github-custom --resume
```

See [`examples/github-server-scoped/`](examples/github-server-scoped/) for the scoped output.
